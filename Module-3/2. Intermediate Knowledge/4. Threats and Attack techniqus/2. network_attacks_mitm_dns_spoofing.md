# Network Attacks: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) and DNS Spoofing

This guide provides an in-depth look into **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** and **DNS Spoofing** attacks with detailed practical scenarios, offensive techniques, defensive measures, and hands-on examples.

---

## 1. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack

### Practical Scenario:
An attacker intercepts and alters communications between an employee and an internal service (e.g., webmail or file-sharing service). The attacker listens to sensitive conversations or alters data in transit without either party being aware.

---

### Offensive Perspective (How to Attack)

1. **Reconnaissance**:
   - Identify targets on the local network using tools like **Nmap** to scan for active devices and identify IPs and open ports.
   - Example command:  
     ```bash
     nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
     ```

2. **Set Up ARP Poisoning**:
   - Use **Ettercap** or **Bettercap** to perform **ARP poisoning**, tricking the victim’s device into routing traffic through the attacker’s system.
   - Command example (Bettercap):  
     ```bash
     sudo bettercap -X --target 192.168.1.100
     ```
   - This command intercepts all traffic between the victim and the router, enabling the attacker to monitor and manipulate the traffic.

3. **Intercept Traffic**:
   - Use **Wireshark** to capture traffic between the victim and the server. Focus on protocols like **HTTP**, **FTP**, and **SMTP** to capture sensitive data.
   - Example filter in Wireshark:  
     ```bash
     http or ftp or smtp
     ```

4. **Capture Unencrypted Credentials**:
   - If the victim accesses non-encrypted services (e.g., HTTP), the attacker can capture login credentials, session cookies, and other sensitive information.

5. **Modify Data in Transit**:
   - The attacker can modify data before forwarding it to the server or the client, such as injecting malicious scripts or altering page content in transit.

---

### Defensive Perspective (How to Protect Against MITM)

1. **Use End-to-End Encryption**:
   - Enforce **SSL/TLS** on all services to ensure that all data in transit is encrypted. Enable **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)** to enforce HTTPS.

2. **Enable Strong Network Authentication**:
   - Use **WPA3** encryption on Wi-Fi networks and ensure strong authentication on sensitive devices.

3. **Monitor for ARP Poisoning**:
   - Use intrusion detection systems (IDS) like **Snort** or **Suricata** to detect abnormal ARP traffic patterns.

4. **Use VPNs for Remote Users**:
   - Ensure employees use **VPNs** when accessing company resources remotely to provide encrypted communication even on insecure networks.

5. **Educate Employees**:
   - Teach employees to recognize browser warnings for insecure connections (non-HTTPS) and avoid entering sensitive information on such sites.

---

### Hands-On Example: MITM Attack

1. **Step 1: Set Up a Network Lab**:
   - Create a local network using **VirtualBox** or physical routers with at least two devices (attacker and victim).

2. **Step 2: Perform ARP Poisoning**:
   - Use **Ettercap** or **Bettercap** to poison ARP tables and intercept traffic between the victim and router.

3. **Step 3: Capture HTTP Traffic**:
   - Use **Wireshark** to monitor the victim’s HTTP traffic and capture sensitive information like usernames and passwords.

4. **Step 4: Modify Data**:
   - Use **Ettercap** to inject malicious code or alter the HTTP response in real time.

5. **Step 5: Defensive Countermeasures**:
   - Enable HTTPS and ensure a valid SSL certificate is enforced for all services. Demonstrate the impact of encryption in preventing successful MITM attacks.

## 2. DNS Spoofing Attack

### Practical Scenario:
An attacker spoofs DNS responses to redirect users from legitimate websites (e.g., internal webmail) to a malicious website that steals login credentials.

---

### Offensive Perspective (How to Attack)

1. **Set Up a Fake DNS Server**:
   - Use tools like **dnsspoof** to perform DNS poisoning, redirecting legitimate domain requests to a malicious IP address.
   - Example command:  
     ```bash
     dnsspoof -i eth0 host mail.company.com
     ```

2. **Host a Malicious Website**:
   - Clone the legitimate website using **HTTrack** and host it on your server. For example, clone `mail.company.com` and host it at `http://192.168.1.10`.

3. **Deploy the Attack**:
   - Poison the victim’s DNS cache, causing the victim’s machine to resolve the domain (e.g., `mail.company.com`) to the attacker’s server.

4. **Steal Credentials**:
   - Once the victim visits the fake website, capture their credentials using a backend script on the attacker's server.

5. **Monitor DNS Traffic**:
   - Use **Wireshark** to monitor DNS traffic and ensure that all DNS queries for the target domain are being redirected successfully.

---

### Defensive Perspective (How to Protect Against DNS Spoofing)

1. **Use DNSSEC**:
   - **DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)** adds cryptographic signatures to DNS responses, ensuring the authenticity of the DNS data.

2. **Enable HTTPS and HSTS**:
   - Force all services to use **HTTPS** with **HSTS**, so even if DNS is spoofed, the victim will see an SSL error when the fake site attempts to load over HTTP.

3. **Monitor DNS Traffic**:
   - Use DNS monitoring tools like **DNSFilter** to detect abnormal DNS responses or suspicious redirections.

4. **Harden DNS Servers**:
   - Secure internal DNS servers with **firewall rules** and restrict access to authorized devices.

5. **Cache Poisoning Prevention**:
   - Use DNS servers with randomized query IDs and source ports to prevent cache poisoning attacks.

6. **Use VPNs**:
   - VPNs can route all DNS traffic through a secure, encrypted tunnel, preventing DNS spoofing even on compromised networks.

---

### Hands-On Example: DNS Spoofing Attack

1. **Step 1: Set Up a Local DNS Lab**:
   - Configure a simple network with a victim machine and an attacker machine. Set up a local DNS server on the attacker machine.

2. **Step 2: Host a Malicious Website**:
   - Use **HTTrack** to clone the legitimate login page (e.g., `mail.company.com`) and host it on the attacker’s machine using **Apache**.

3. **Step 3: Perform DNS Spoofing**:
   - Use **dnsspoof** to poison the victim’s DNS cache and redirect traffic from `mail.company.com` to the attacker's fake login page.
   - Example command:  
     ```bash
     dnsspoof -i eth0 host mail.company.com
     ```

4. **Step 4: Capture Credentials**:
   - Once the victim enters their login credentials on the fake page, capture them using a backend script on the attacker’s machine.

5. **Step 5: Defensive Countermeasures**:
   - Implement **DNSSEC** and enforce **HTTPS** with **HSTS** to prevent DNS spoofing attacks from succeeding.

## Conclusion

**Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** and **DNS Spoofing** attacks are common network-level threats that exploit weaknesses in communication between systems. Understanding both the offensive and defensive measures provides insight into how these attacks are executed and how to effectively protect against them.
