## 1. Setting Up a Patch Management System

### Tools Used:
- **Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)** for Windows environments.
- **Automox** or **ManageEngine Patch Manager** for cross-platform environments.

### Hands-On Exercise 1: WSUS Setup and Configuration (Windows)

**Objective**: Configure WSUS on a Windows Server to manage and deploy patches across your Windows environment.

1. **Step 1: Installing WSUS**:
   - Open **Server Manager** on your Windows Server.
   - Navigate to **Add Roles and Features**.
   - In the **Select Server Roles** window, select **Windows Server Update Services**.
   - Follow the prompts and select a location to store WSUS updates.

2. **Step 2: WSUS Configuration**:
   - Open **WSUS Management Console** after installation.
   - Set the **Upstream Server** (either Microsoft Update or another WSUS server).
   - Choose **languages** and **products** to download updates for (e.g., Windows 10, Office 365).
   - Set synchronization schedules (e.g., daily or weekly).

3. **Step 3: Group Policies**:
   - Use **Group Policy Editor** to configure automatic updates on client systems.
   - Set policies to automatically detect and download patches from WSUS.

4. **Step 4: Patch Approval**:
   - In WSUS Console, click on **Updates**, filter **Critical Updates**, and **approve** necessary patches for different system groups.

### Hands-On Exercise 2: Automox Setup (Cross-Platform Patching)

**Objective**: Automate patching across Windows, Linux, and macOS using Automox, a cloud-based solution.

1. **Step 1: Register for Automox**:
   - Create an account on **Automox** and log in to the console.

2. **Step 2: Agent Installation**:
   - Download and install the Automox agent on your devices (Windows, Linux, macOS).
   - The agent will automatically report back to the Automox console for updates and patch management.

3. **Step 3: Create Patch Policies**:
   - Create separate patch policies for Windows, Linux, and macOS systems.
   - Define how often patches should be checked, downloaded, and installed (e.g., daily or weekly).

4. **Step 4: Automated Patch Deployment**:
   - Once the policy is created, Automox will handle patch detection, download, and deployment based on the policy settings.
   - Monitor the patching process in real-time using the Automox dashboard.

> **Tip**: Automox can be integrated with third-party security solutions to notify you of vulnerabilities, allowing automatic patch deployment for fast remediation.

## 2. Patch Testing in a Lab Environment

**Objective**: Safely test patches in a lab environment before deploying them to production to ensure they don’t cause compatibility issues or disrupt services.

### Hands-On Exercise 3: Setting Up a Test Environment

1. **Step 1: Create Virtual Machines**:
   - Use **VMware** or **VirtualBox** to create test virtual machines that mirror your production environment.
   - Set up operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) on the VMs.

2. **Step 2: Apply the Patch**:
   - Download the patch that needs testing (e.g., from the vendor’s website or WSUS).
   - Apply it to the test VM environment.

3. **Step 3: Test for Compatibility**:
   - Run core services and applications that are critical to your business (e.g., web servers, database systems).
   - Check logs and monitor the performance of the system post-patch application to identify any disruptions.

4. **Step 4: Monitor for Stability**:
   - Allow the patch to run on the test system for a few hours or even a day, depending on the complexity of the environment, to detect any issues.

> **Advanced Practice**: Use containers (Docker or Kubernetes) for testing patches to see how they affect microservices architecture.

## 3. Patch Deployment

Once patches have been tested and prioritized, they can be deployed across the organization. Deployment methods vary depending on the tools used (WSUS, Automox, etc.).

### Hands-On Exercise 4: Deploying Patches Using WSUS

1. **Step 1: Select Systems for Deployment**:
   - Create groups within WSUS (e.g., “Servers,” “Workstations”).
   - Assign systems to the appropriate groups.

2. **Step 2: Approve Updates**:
   - In WSUS, select the **Updates** tab.
   - Filter by **Critical Updates** and **Security Updates**.
   - Click **Approve** to schedule deployment to target system groups.

3. **Step 3: Monitor Deployment**:
   - Use WSUS reporting features to monitor the success of patch deployment.
   - Investigate any systems that failed to install the patch.

### Hands-On Exercise 5: Deploying Patches Using Automox

1. **Step 1: Define a Maintenance Window**:
   - In the Automox console, set up a **Maintenance Window** to deploy patches during off-hours or when minimal disruption will occur.

2. **Step 2: Real-Time Patch Monitoring**:
   - Monitor the patch deployment in real-time.
   - Use the **Patch Failure Logs** to troubleshoot systems where the patch failed to apply.

3. **Step 3: Verification**:
   - After patch deployment, ensure that services and applications on critical systems are functioning correctly.

> **Advanced Task**: For large-scale environments, practice deploying patches using APIs for automation (Integrate WSUS or Automox with custom scripts).

---

## 4. Post-Patch Verification and Troubleshooting

Post-patch verification ensures that patches were successfully applied and systems remain stable. It is a crucial step to prevent operational disruptions or unpatched vulnerabilities.

### Hands-On Exercise 6: Patch Verification

1. **Step 1: Use Monitoring Tools**:
   - Use tools like **Nagios** or **Zabbix** to monitor your environment post-patch deployment.
   - Ensure critical services are running normally.

2. **Step 2: Review Patch Reports**:
   - For WSUS: Use the **WSUS Reporting** feature to generate patch deployment reports.
   - For Automox: Check the **Automox Dashboard** for detailed logs on patch success and failure.

3. **Step 3: Run Vulnerability Scans**:
   - After patch deployment, run a vulnerability scan using tools like **Nessus** or **OpenVAS** to confirm that the vulnerability is no longer present.
   - Ensure that the system is now secure and free from the vulnerabilities that were addressed by the patch.

> **Tip**: Automate post-patch scanning by integrating **Nessus** with your patch management system.

## 5. Troubleshooting Patch Failures

Sometimes patches fail to install or cause system issues. Understanding the reasons behind patch failures and having a rollback plan is crucial.

### Hands-On Exercise 7: Troubleshooting Failed Patches

1. **Step 1: Investigate Logs**:
   - For WSUS: Review the **Windows Event Logs** for patch installation errors.
   - For Automox: Open the **Patch Failure Logs** in the console to view error messages and reasons for failure.

2. **Step 2: Reapply the Patch**:
   - Fix any underlying issues, such as connectivity or disk space, and reapply the patch to the affected systems.

3. **Step 3: Rollback the Patch**:
   - If a patch causes system instability, you may need to roll it back.
   - Use system backups (e.g., **Veeam** or **Acronis**) or the **Uninstall Patch** feature in WSUS to revert to a previous system state.

> **Advanced Task**: Set up automatic backups using **Acronis** or similar tools before patch deployment, ensuring quick rollback in case of failure.

## 6. Patch Management Best Practices

Here are some of the best practices to ensure the smooth execution of patch management:

- **Automate When Possible**: Use tools like Automox, ManageEngine, or WSUS to automate patch detection, deployment, and reporting.
- **Test in a Lab**: Always test patches in a lab environment to prevent potential disruptions in production systems.
- **Prioritize Critical Systems**: Patch high-priority systems like web servers and databases before less critical devices.
- **Keep Records**: Document patching activities and maintain reports for compliance and audit purposes.
- **Regular Scans**: Schedule vulnerability scans before and after patches to detect missing updates and verify the security of your systems.
