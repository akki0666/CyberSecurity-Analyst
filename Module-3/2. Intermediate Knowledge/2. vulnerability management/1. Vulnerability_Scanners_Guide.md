- **Plugin Architecture**: Plugins are used to define vulnerability checks.
- **Compliance Auditing**: Supports auditing for standards like PCI DSS, HIPAA, and CIS.

### 1.2 Practical Installation of Nessus

**Steps to Install Nessus on Linux**:
1. Download the Nessus package from [Tenable's Nessus download page](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus).
   ```bash
   wget https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus -O Nessus-<version>.deb
   ```
2. Install the package:
   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i Nessus-<version>.deb
   ```
3. Start the Nessus service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start nessusd
   ```
4. Access Nessus:
   ```bash
   https://<your_server_ip>:8834
   ```

### 1.3 Using Nessus for Vulnerability Scanning

**Steps to Perform a Network Scan**:
1. Log in to the Nessus web interface.
2. Select **New Scan** and choose a scan template.
3. Configure the scan (target IPs, credentials, policies).
4. Click **Save** and then **Launch**.

### 1.4 Practical Example of Nessus Scan Results

After the scan, Nessus generates reports with details such as:
- **Vulnerabilities**: Categorized by severity.
- **CVE IDs**: Linked to each vulnerability.
- **Remediation**: Suggested fixes.

**Example of Detected Vulnerability**:
```plaintext
Vulnerability: Remote Code Execution in Apache HTTP Server
Severity: Critical
CVE: CVE-2021-41773
Remediation: Apply security patch from Apache.
```

### 1.5 Practical Tips for Nessus Scans
- **Credentialed Scans**: Use administrative credentials for deeper scans.
- **Scan Schedules**: Regularly schedule scans to ensure continuous monitoring.

## 2. OpenVAS

**OpenVAS** (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) is an open-source vulnerability scanner maintained by **Greenbone Networks**.

### 2.1 Key Features of OpenVAS
- **Open-Source**: Free and open-source.
- **Comprehensive Scanning**: Scans for over 50,000 vulnerabilities.
- **Customizable Scan Configurations**: Create custom scan profiles.
- **Integration with GVM**: Integrates with Greenbone Vulnerability Manager.
- **Compliance Auditing**: Includes support for compliance checks.

### 2.2 Practical Installation of OpenVAS

**Steps to Install OpenVAS on Ubuntu**:
1. Add Greenbone repository and install OpenVAS:
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mrazavi/gvm
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install gvm
   ```
2. Initialize OpenVAS:
   ```bash
   sudo gvm-setup
   ```
3. Start OpenVAS:
   ```bash
   sudo gvm-start
   ```
4. Access the Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA):
   ```bash
   https://<your_server_ip>:9392
   ```

### 2.3 Using OpenVAS for Vulnerability Scanning

**Steps to Perform a Scan**:
1. Log in to the Greenbone Security Assistant.
2. Go to **Scans** > **Tasks** > **New Task**.
3. Configure the scan (scan config, target IPs).
4. Save and **Start** the scan.

### 2.4 Practical Example of OpenVAS Scan Results

OpenVAS generates detailed reports with:
- **Vulnerability Details**: Descriptions of vulnerabilities.
- **CVSS Scores**: Severity ratings for each vulnerability.
- **Fix Recommendations**.

**Example of Detected Vulnerability**:
```plaintext
Vulnerability: Outdated OpenSSH Version
Severity: High
CVSS Score: 7.8
Remediation: Upgrade OpenSSH to the latest version.
```

### 2.5 Practical Tips for OpenVAS Scans
- **Regular Feed Updates**: Keep the **Greenbone Security Feed** updated.
- **Custom Scan Configurations**: Customize scans to fit specific needs.
