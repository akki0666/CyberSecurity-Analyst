# Basic Cryptography in Cybersecurity

Cryptography is a crucial element in ensuring the security and confidentiality of data. It primarily involves two processes: **encryption** and **hashing**. This document will delve into these topics, discussing the mechanisms behind two popular encryption algorithms (AES and RSA) and two common hashing algorithms (SHA and MD5).

## 1. Encryption

Encryption is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext, making it unreadable to unauthorized users. There are two main types of encryption:

### 1.1 Symmetric Encryption: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

- **Definition**: AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning it uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.

- **Key Features**:
  - Block Cipher: It encrypts data in fixed-size blocks (128 bits).
  - Key Sizes: Supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
  - Security: Considered highly secure and is widely used in various applications.

- **Example**:
    - **Encryption Process**: 
      1. Plaintext: "Hello World"
      2. Key: "examplekey12345" (128-bit key)
      3. Ciphertext: The output will be a seemingly random string.

- **Implementation**: AES can be implemented using various programming languages and libraries. For example, in Python, you can use the `pycryptodome` library:

    ```python
    from Crypto.Cipher import AES
    from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad, unpad
    import os

    # Key and initialization vector (IV) generation
    key = os.urandom(16)  # 128-bit key
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC)
    iv = cipher.iv

    # Encrypting the plaintext
    plaintext = b'Hello World'
    ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(pad(plaintext, AES.block_size))
    ```

### 1.2 Asymmetric Encryption: RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)

- **Definition**: RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm, which means it uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

- **Key Features**:
  - Key Length: Commonly uses key lengths of 2048 or 4096 bits for security.
  - Security Basis: Relies on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.

- **Example**:
    - **Key Generation**:
      1. Generate two large prime numbers (p and q).
      2. Compute n = p * q (modulus for public and private keys).
      3. Calculate the totient: φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1).
      4. Choose a public exponent (e) such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1.
      5. Calculate the private exponent (d) such that d ≡ e^(-1) (mod φ(n)).

- **Implementation**: RSA can be implemented using libraries like `cryptography` in Python:

    ```python
    from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
    from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import rsa

    # Generate private key
    private_key = rsa.generate_private_key(
        public_exponent=65537,
        key_size=2048,
        backend=default_backend()
    )
    public_key = private_key.public_key()
    ```

## 2. Hashing

Hashing transforms data into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hash value. Unlike encryption, hashing is a one-way function, meaning it cannot be reversed to retrieve the original data.

### 2.1 SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)

- **Definition**: SHA is a family of cryptographic hash functions designed by the NSA.

- **Key Features**:
  - Output Size: SHA-256 generates a 256-bit hash value.
  - Collision Resistance: It is computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value.

- **Example**:
    - **Hashing Process**:
      1. Input: "Hello World"
      2. Hash Value: The output will be a fixed-length string, e.g., `a591a6d40bf420404a501a45cde4d5e5d5d2c6a7c1b2d1c4e1c0c3fabc60414` for SHA-256.

- **Implementation**: SHA can be implemented using the `hashlib` library in Python:

    ```python
    import hashlib

    # Hashing using SHA-256
    input_data = b'Hello World'
    sha256_hash = hashlib.sha256(input_data).hexdigest()
    ```

### 2.2 MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)

- **Definition**: MD5 is a widely used hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value.

- **Key Features**:
  - Fast: MD5 is known for its speed in hashing.
  - Vulnerabilities: MD5 is no longer considered secure against collision attacks.

- **Example**:
    - **Hashing Process**:
      1. Input: "Hello World"
      2. Hash Value: The output will be a fixed-length string, e.g., `5eb63bbbe01eeed093cb22bb8f5acdc3` for MD5.

- **Implementation**: MD5 can also be implemented using the `hashlib` library in Python:

    ```python
    import hashlib

    # Hashing using MD5
    input_data = b'Hello World'
    md5_hash = hashlib.md5(input_data).hexdigest()
    ```

## Conclusion

Understanding the fundamentals of encryption and hashing is crucial for anyone involved in cybersecurity. These techniques help protect data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity in various applications, from secure communications to data storage.
