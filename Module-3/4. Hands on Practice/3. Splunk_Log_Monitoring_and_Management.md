## Scenario: Setting Up Splunk for Log Monitoring

**Objective**: Set up Splunk to collect and analyze logs from various sources such as web servers, firewalls, and application servers. Perform searches, create dashboards, and set up alerts based on specific log events.

### Step 1: Installing and Configuring Splunk

1. **Download and Install Splunk**:
   - Download Splunk from the [Splunk website](https://www.splunk.com/).
   - Install Splunk on your preferred platform (Linux, Windows, or Mac).

   Example installation on Linux:
   ```bash
   dpkg -i splunk-package.deb
   ```
   After installation, start Splunk:
   ```bash
   ./splunk start
   ```
   Follow the instructions to set the admin username and password.

2. **Log In to Splunk**:
   - Access Splunk’s web interface by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` (or the relevant IP address if installed on a remote server).
   - Log in using the admin credentials you created during the installation.

3. **Configure Data Inputs**:
   - Navigate to **Settings > Add Data** to set up data inputs.
   - Choose a data source, such as log files from a web server (`/var/log/apache2/access.log`) or firewall logs.

### Step 2: Collecting and Analyzing Logs

1. **Log File Monitoring**:
   - Set up monitoring for a web server log file:
     ```bash
     /var/log/apache2/access.log
     ```
   - In Splunk, create a new file input under **Settings > Data Inputs > Files & Directories** and point it to the location of the log file.

2. **Search for Log Events**:
   - Example search query for HTTP status codes in Apache logs:
     ```bash
     sourcetype="access_combined" status=404
     ```
   - This search will return all events where the HTTP status code is 404.

3. **Time-based Search**:
   ```bash
   sourcetype="access_combined" status=404 earliest=-1h
   ```
   - This query searches for 404 errors in the last hour.

4. **Field Extraction**:
   ```bash
   sourcetype="access_combined" clientip=192.168.1.100
   ```

### Step 3: Creating Dashboards for Visualization

1. **Create a Dashboard**:
   - Click **Create New Dashboard** in the Splunk interface.

2. **Add a Search Query to the Dashboard**:
   - Add a search query like `sourcetype="access_combined" status=404` and display it as a time chart.

3. **Customize the Dashboard**:
   - Add panels to track HTTP errors, user logins, or failed authentications.

---

### Step 4: Setting Up Alerts Based on Log Events

1. **Create an Alert for Critical Events**:
   - Navigate to **Settings > Searches, Reports, and Alerts** and create a new alert.

2. **Define the Search Query**:
   ```bash
   sourcetype="access_combined" status=500 | stats count by _time
   ```
   - Set the alert to trigger if the count exceeds a certain threshold.

3. **Configure Alert Actions**:
   - Send an email, run a script, or generate a report.

---

### Step 5: Searching for Security Events in Logs

1. **Search for Unauthorized Access Attempts**:
   ```bash
   sourcetype="access_combined" status=403 OR status=401
   ```

2. **Detect Unusual Activity**:
   ```bash
   sourcetype="access_combined" | stats count by clientip | where count > 100
   ```

## Practical Scenario: Monitoring Web Application Logs with Splunk

**Objective**: Use Splunk to monitor logs from a web application, detect unusual traffic, and create a dashboard for real-time monitoring.

### Steps:

1. **Set Up Web Server Log Monitoring**:
   - Configure Splunk to monitor logs of your web server.

2. **Create Dashboards to Visualize Traffic**:
   - Build dashboards that display traffic patterns, errors, and user activity.

3. **Set Up Security Alerts**:
   - Create alerts for abnormal activity, such as brute force attacks or a spike in HTTP errors.
