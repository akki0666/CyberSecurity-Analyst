# SOC Workflows: Real-Time Threat Monitoring and Alert Triaging

This guide provides detailed practical scenarios for two essential **SOC (Security Operations Center) workflows** — **Real-Time Threat Monitoring** and **Alert Triaging**, covering both theoretical concepts and hands-on practical examples.

## 1. Real-Time Threat Monitoring

### Practical Scenario:
A SOC team monitors the company's network infrastructure using a **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system like **Splunk** or **QRadar**. Their goal is to detect potential threats and respond quickly to anomalies.

---

### Real-Time Threat Monitoring Workflow

1. **Data Collection and Aggregation**:
   - Logs are collected from various sources like **firewalls**, **IDS/IPS**, **endpoints**, and **web servers**.
   - **Example**: A firewall sends logs of all network traffic, and the SIEM aggregates this data for analysis.

2. **Event Correlation**:
   - The SIEM system uses correlation rules to identify patterns of malicious activity, such as multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful login.
   - **Example**: If there are 5 failed logins from the same IP within 5 minutes, an alert is triggered.

3. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - The SIEM uses **machine learning** or **threshold-based detection** to spot abnormal behavior, such as large data transfers outside of business hours.
   - **Example**: A spike in data transfers from an employee’s machine to an external IP at 3 AM triggers an alert.

4. **Threat Intelligence Integration**:
   - The SIEM integrates **threat intelligence feeds** to identify known malicious IPs, domains, or file hashes. Alerts are triggered if known threats are detected.
   - **Example**: Communication with a known command-and-control (C2) server is flagged as malicious, raising an alert.

---

### Hands-On Example: Real-Time Threat Monitoring

1. **Step 1: SIEM Setup (e.g., Splunk or QRadar)**:
   - Set up a SIEM (Splunk, QRadar, or **ELK Stack**) to monitor network traffic and aggregate logs from firewalls, servers, and endpoint devices.

2. **Step 2: Collect and Normalize Logs**:
   - Connect data sources like firewalls, IDS/IPS, and web servers. Ensure all logs are normalized for easy analysis.

3. **Step 3: Event Correlation**:
   - Configure rules such as:  
     - **Rule Example**: 10 failed login attempts within 5 minutes trigger an alert.

4. **Step 4: Threat Intelligence**:
   - Integrate feeds like **AlienVault OTX** to check incoming traffic against known malicious IPs or domains.

5. **Step 5: Monitor Dashboards**:
   - Use SIEM dashboards to monitor login attempts, failed authentications, and unusual data transfers.

6. **Step 6: Real-Time Detection**:
   - Investigate when traffic is flagged as communicating with a known malicious IP.

## 2. Alert Triaging

### Practical Scenario:
A SOC analyst receives an alert from the SIEM system. The alert flags suspicious user activity, such as accessing sensitive files after working hours. The analyst must triage the alert, determine its severity, and respond accordingly.

---

### Alert Triaging Workflow

1. **Alert Categorization**:
   - The SOC team categorizes alerts based on severity. For example, critical alerts (e.g., data exfiltration) require immediate action, while low-priority events (e.g., failed logins) may not.
   - **Example**: An alert for unauthorized file access is flagged as a medium-priority event.

2. **Investigate the Source of the Alert**:
   - The analyst reviews logs and user activity, looking for deviations from normal behavior.
   - **Example**: The alert shows access to sensitive files outside of working hours. The analyst checks logs for additional suspicious behavior.

3. **Contextualize the Alert**:
   - The analyst examines related events, such as multiple alerts for the same user or device, to assess the overall context.
   - **Example**: The analyst notices the user tried to send large files to an external IP, raising suspicion of data exfiltration.

4. **Threat Escalation or Dismissal**:
   - The analyst escalates the case to the incident response team if needed or dismisses it if it's a false positive.
   - **Example**: After confirming suspicious behavior, the analyst escalates the case for further investigation.

---

### Hands-On Example: Alert Triaging

1. **Step 1: Review the Alert in SIEM**:
   - Open the SIEM dashboard and examine the alert related to suspicious file access.

2. **Step 2: Analyze Logs**:
   - Review the event logs, including **source IP**, **time of access**, and the action performed.

3. **Step 3: Assess Severity**:
   - Use predefined criteria to categorize the alert. Check if the alert is part of a larger pattern (e.g., multiple failed logins or file transfers).

4. **Step 4: Investigate User Activity**:
   - Investigate the user’s activity history to determine if the behavior is normal or part of malicious intent.

5. **Step 5: Escalate or Resolve**:
   - If malicious behavior is suspected, escalate to the incident response team. If it's a false positive, close the alert with documented reasoning.

## Additional Practical Scenario 1: Detecting Ransomware

**Scenario**: An employee's machine shows unusual activity — multiple files are being encrypted rapidly, and network traffic spikes. The SOC team receives a real-time alert indicating potential ransomware activity.

### Workflow

1. **Log Collection**: Logs from endpoints show mass file modifications.
2. **Anomaly Detection**: The SIEM identifies a high volume of encrypted files.
3. **Alert Review**: The SOC analyst confirms unusual file activity and escalating network traffic.
4. **Investigation**: The analyst reviews logs for ransomware indicators, such as processes modifying many files and connections to external IPs.
5. **Action**: The incident response team isolates the affected machine and shuts down network connections to prevent further damage.

---

## Additional Practical Scenario 2: Phishing Campaign Detection

**Scenario**: A SOC analyst notices an increase in failed login attempts, followed by multiple users reporting suspicious emails containing links to a malicious website. The SIEM raises an alert for potential phishing activity.

### Workflow

1. **Log Collection**: Logs from the email gateway and endpoints reveal users clicking on phishing links.
2. **Event Correlation**: The SIEM detects a pattern of failed login attempts from users who received the phishing emails.
3. **Threat Intelligence**: The phishing links are flagged by external threat intelligence feeds.
4. **Alert Review**: The SOC analyst reviews email headers, user reports, and malicious domains.
5. **Response**: The SOC escalates the case to the incident response team, which blocks the malicious domains and forces password resets for affected users.

## Deep Dive into Key Concepts

#### Real-Time Threat Monitoring

- **Log Aggregation**: SOC teams collect logs from various sources such as firewalls, IDS, and endpoints to analyze security data in real time.
- **Automated Event Correlation**: SIEM systems correlate logs and events to identify patterns of malicious activity, such as brute-force attempts or data exfiltration.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning and threshold-based detections help spot abnormal behavior in network traffic, file access, or user activities.

#### Alert Triaging

- **Alert Categorization**: SOC analysts classify alerts based on their severity and prioritize high-risk threats such as data breaches, while lower-priority events are monitored or dismissed.
- **False Positives**: SOC analysts must carefully distinguish between true threats and false positives by cross-referencing logs, user activity, and contextual information.
- **Escalation Procedures**: If an alert is serious, the SOC escalates the case to the incident response team for immediate action, such as containment, investigation, and remediation.

## Conclusion

**Real-Time Threat Monitoring** and **Alert Triaging** are crucial SOC workflows for identifying and responding to security threats in real time. Monitoring logs, correlating events, and effectively triaging alerts ensure that SOC analysts can prioritize true threats and respond quickly to security incidents.
