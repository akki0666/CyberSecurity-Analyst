# Malware Analysis Tools: IDA Pro, OllyDbg, and Ghidra

## Introduction to Malware Analysis
Malware analysis is the process of dissecting malicious software (malware) to understand its functionality, origin, and potential impact. Analyzing malware involves two primary approaches:

1. **Static Analysis**: Inspecting the malware’s code and structure without executing it.
2. **Dynamic Analysis**: Running the malware in a controlled environment to observe its behavior.

This scenario walks through a detailed analysis of a malware sample using three key tools: **IDA Pro**, **OllyDbg**, and **Ghidra**.

## Scenario Setup
You receive a suspicious executable file from your organization’s incident response team. The file has been flagged by a few antivirus engines but is not widely recognized. You are tasked with understanding its behavior, functionalities, and the threats it poses. Your goal is to use the following malware analysis tools:

- **IDA Pro** for static analysis.
- **OllyDbg** for dynamic analysis.
- **Ghidra** as a secondary static analysis tool and to validate findings.

### Step 1: Static Analysis with IDA Pro

**Objective**: Disassemble the malware to examine its code, identify system calls, functions, and strings without executing it.

#### Steps:

1. **Load the Malware into IDA Pro**: Open the file in IDA Pro and let it disassemble the code.
2. **Navigate Functions and System Calls**: 
   - IDA Pro allows you to examine key functions and API calls such as `CreateProcess`, `WriteFile`, `RegOpenKey`.
3. **String Analysis**: Use IDA Pro’s string window to analyze hardcoded strings such as IP addresses, URLs, and file paths.
4. **Cross-References**: Identify cross-references for suspicious functions.

#### Deep Dive with IDA Pro:

- **Function Graphs**: Use flow charts to visualize control flow.
- **Signature Matching**: Compare disassembled code against malware signatures.

#### Outcome:

You discover that the malware communicates via HTTP to a remote C2 server.

### Step 2: Dynamic Analysis with OllyDbg

**Objective**: Execute the malware in a controlled environment to observe runtime behavior.

#### Steps:

1. **Load the Malware into OllyDbg**: Open the executable in OllyDbg.
2. **Set Breakpoints**: Place breakpoints on key functions like `CreateProcess`, `WriteFile`.
3. **Step through Code**: Step through each instruction to observe data manipulation.
4. **Inspect Memory and Registers**: Monitor memory and CPU registers for unpacked payloads.

#### Deep Dive with OllyDbg:

- **Shellcode Analysis**: Trace the execution of injected shellcode.
- **Process Injection Detection**: Track process hollowing or injection techniques.

#### Outcome:

You observe the malware attempting to create a reverse shell and log keystrokes.

### Step 3: Supplementary Analysis with Ghidra

**Objective**: Cross-validate findings using Ghidra.

#### Steps:

1. **Load the Malware in Ghidra**: Use Ghidra for decompilation into pseudo-C code.
2. **Analyze Decompiled Code**: Ghidra provides human-readable C-like code.
3. **Cross-check Results**: Verify findings from IDA Pro with Ghidra.

#### Deep Dive with Ghidra:

- **Scripting Support**: Automate tasks using Python or Java.
- **Versioning Support**: Track malware evolution over time.

#### Outcome:

Ghidra confirms your IDA Pro findings and helps identify obfuscated sections.

## Additional Practical Scenarios

### Scenario 2: Analyzing a Ransomware Sample

**Objective**: Analyze a ransomware executable to understand its encryption behavior.

#### Steps:
1. **Load the malware in IDA Pro** and locate cryptographic functions like `CryptEncrypt`.
2. **Set breakpoints in OllyDbg** on the encryption routines and observe how the ransomware encrypts files.
3. **Use Ghidra** to decompile the code and examine the key-generation algorithm.

#### Outcome:
You discover that the ransomware encrypts files using AES and communicates the key to a remote server.

---

### Scenario 3: Analyzing a Packed Malware Sample

**Objective**: Unpack malware to reveal its payload.

#### Steps:
1. **Use OllyDbg** to step through the malware until the unpacking routine is complete.
2. **Dump the unpacked payload** from memory.
3. **Analyze the unpacked payload** using IDA Pro and Ghidra to reveal its hidden functionality.

#### Outcome:
You uncover a secondary payload that launches a DDoS attack on a remote target.

---

### Conclusion

By combining **static analysis** (IDA Pro, Ghidra) and **dynamic analysis** (OllyDbg), you can uncover the malware’s functionality, network behavior, and evasion techniques. Each tool offers unique advantages in reverse engineering and analyzing malware.
