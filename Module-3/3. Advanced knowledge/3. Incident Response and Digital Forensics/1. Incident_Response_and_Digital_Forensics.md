# Incident Response and Digital Forensics: Autopsy and FTK Imager

## Introduction
Incident Response and Digital Forensics are critical components of cybersecurity. They involve identifying, analyzing, and responding to security breaches. Forensic tools such as **Autopsy** and **FTK Imager** help investigators recover digital evidence, understand attack vectors, and assess damage.

### Incident Response Phases:
1. **Preparation**: Prepare tools and protocols for responding to incidents.
2. **Identification**: Detect the breach and assess its scope.
3. **Containment**: Limit the damage by isolating affected systems.
4. **Eradication**: Remove malware and other threats.
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems to a secure state.
6. **Lessons Learned**: Analyze the incident to prevent future breaches.

### Digital Forensics Phases:
1. **Acquisition**: Capture a forensic image of data.
2. **Examination**: Use forensic tools to find relevant data.
3. **Analysis**: Interpret the data and correlate it with the incident.
4. **Reporting**: Document the findings for legal or internal use.

## Scenario 1: Compromised Server Investigation

### Step 1: Acquisition with FTK Imager

**Objective**: Create a forensic image of the server’s drive.

#### Steps:
1. **Load FTK Imager**: Launch FTK Imager.
2. **Select the Source Drive**: Connect and select the compromised drive.
3. **Create a Forensic Image**: Choose E01 or raw format, generate hash values.
4. **Save and Verify**: Verify the image integrity with hash comparisons.

#### Deep Dive:
- **Memory Dump**: Capture a live memory dump to investigate malware in RAM.
- **Logical Acquisition**: Acquire specific directories of interest for quicker analysis.

#### Outcome:
A forensic image and memory dump are ready for analysis.

### Step 2: Analysis with Autopsy

**Objective**: Analyze the forensic image to identify the attack vector.

#### Steps:
1. **Load the Image**: Load the image into Autopsy and parse the file system.
2. **Analyze the File System**: Recover deleted files and check file signatures.
3. **Keyword Search**: Search for sensitive data and exfiltration attempts.
4. **Timeline Analysis**: Analyze timestamps to trace the attack timeline.

#### Deep Dive:
- **Email and Browser Artifacts**: Analyze web browsing and email activity.
- **Registry Analysis**: Examine Windows registry keys for malware persistence.
- **EXIF Data**: Extract geolocation and metadata from images.

#### Outcome:
Sensitive data exfiltration and malware persistence methods are identified.

### Step 3: Reporting and Post-Incident Response

**Objective**: Summarize findings and help the team secure the system.

#### Steps:
1. **Generate Forensic Report**: Document the results using Autopsy’s report generator.
2. **Coordinate with Incident Response**: Share findings and recommend remediation steps.
3. **Post-Incident Actions**: Implement new monitoring policies and patch exploited vulnerabilities.

#### Outcome:
The incident response team eradicates the threat, secures the environment, and prevents future attacks.

## Additional Practical Scenarios

### Scenario 2: USB Data Theft Investigation

**Objective**: Investigate unauthorized data transfer using a USB device.

#### Steps:
1. **Acquire the USB Device**: Use FTK Imager to create an image of the USB device.
2. **Analyze with Autopsy**: Recover deleted files, identify the time of access, and review modification history.
3. **Cross-reference Logs**: Use system logs to identify which computer the USB was plugged into and when.

#### Outcome:
You discover that sensitive company files were copied to the USB drive, along with the workstation and user involved.

### Scenario 3: Malware in RAM Investigation

**Objective**: Analyze malware residing only in volatile memory (RAM).

#### Steps:
1. **Capture RAM with FTK Imager**: Perform a memory dump of the affected system.
2. **Analyze with Volatility (optional tool)**: Identify processes and network connections in memory.
3. **Correlate with Autopsy Findings**: Examine system files and logs for how the malware entered the system.

#### Outcome:
The malware’s runtime behavior and C2 server connection are identified from memory.

### Scenario 4: Ransomware Attack Investigation

**Objective**: Investigate a ransomware attack and recover files.

#### Steps:
1. **Image the Infected System**: Use FTK Imager to capture a forensic image.
2. **Identify Encryption Algorithms**: Use Autopsy to analyze cryptographic functions used by ransomware.
3. **Decrypt Files (if possible)**: Investigate any potential for decryption of affected files.
4. **Timeline the Attack**: Identify when the ransomware was triggered and which files were encrypted first.

#### Outcome:
You identify the encryption mechanism, provide a timeline for the attack, and suggest mitigations to recover or restore affected files.
