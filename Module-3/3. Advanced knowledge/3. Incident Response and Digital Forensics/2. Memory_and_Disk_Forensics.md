# Memory and Disk Forensics: Detailed Practical Scenarios

## Introduction to Memory and Disk Forensics
Memory and disk forensics are crucial techniques in digital forensics, helping investigators acquire, preserve, and analyze volatile and non-volatile data to uncover digital evidence. Memory forensics focuses on the analysis of volatile memory (RAM), while disk forensics deals with hard drives and storage devices.

### Why Memory Forensics?
Memory forensics is essential for identifying malware or activities that reside only in volatile memory, such as fileless malware. Memory analysis provides insights into active network connections, running processes, and the system’s state at the time of the breach.

### Why Disk Forensics?
Disk forensics uncovers critical evidence like deleted files, hidden data, and logs of activities. It’s used to trace the attack timeline, detect malware, and identify data exfiltration attempts.

## Scenario 1: Investigating a Security Breach

### Memory Forensics

#### Step 1: Memory Acquisition

**Objective**: Capture the volatile memory from compromised systems.

#### Tools:
- **FTK Imager** or **Belkasoft Live RAM Capturer** for memory dump.
- **Volatility** for memory analysis.

#### Steps:
1. **Capture Memory**: Use FTK Imager to capture the volatile memory from the compromised system.
2. **Verify Integrity**: Hash the memory dump to ensure data integrity.

#### Deep Dive:
Memory forensics is crucial when dealing with malware that does not leave traces on the disk (e.g., fileless malware). Encryption keys, running processes, and active connections can only be found in memory.

#### Step 2: Analyzing the Memory Dump

**Objective**: Detect malicious processes, network connections, and malware.

#### Tool: **Volatility Framework**

#### Steps:
1. **Process Listing**: Use Volatility’s `pslist` to list running processes and look for anomalies.
2. **DLL and Handles**: Analyze the loaded DLLs using `dlllist` to detect injected malicious code.
3. **Network Connections**: Use `netscan` to identify suspicious network connections.
4. **Memory Artifacts**: Extract credentials or encryption keys from memory using `dumpcerts` and `hashdump`.

#### Outcome:
You uncover a hidden process communicating with a known malware command-and-control (C2) server.

### Disk Forensics

#### Step 1: Disk Imaging

**Objective**: Create a forensic image of the compromised systems.

#### Tools:
- **FTK Imager** or **dd** for creating the image.
- **Autopsy** for analysis.

#### Steps:
1. **Image the Disk**: Use FTK Imager to create a bit-by-bit copy of the disk.
2. **Hash the Image**: Verify the integrity of the image using MD5 and SHA1 hashes.

#### Deep Dive:
Disk imaging is the first step in disk forensics, ensuring the integrity of evidence while working on the copy.

#### Step 2: Disk Analysis

**Objective**: Recover deleted files, identify malware, and analyze disk activity.

#### Tool: **Autopsy**

#### Steps:
1. **File System Analysis**: Recover deleted files and check for malicious executables.
2. **Keyword Search**: Search for terms like “password” or “confidential” to find sensitive data.
3. **Timeline Analysis**: Reconstruct the sequence of events using file timestamps.
4. **Web Artifacts**: Check browsing history and cached files for phishing sites or downloads.

#### Outcome:
Disk forensics reveals that the attacker copied sensitive data to an external device before deleting traces.

## Additional Practical Scenarios

### Scenario 2: Ransomware Attack Investigation

**Objective**: Analyze memory and disk to identify the ransomware variant and investigate recovery possibilities.

#### Steps:
1. **Memory Analysis**: Identify the encryption keys or algorithm used by the ransomware.
2. **Disk Forensics**: Recover any unencrypted files and analyze the ransom note for details.
3. **Timeline Analysis**: Identify when the ransomware was deployed.

#### Outcome:
You discover the encryption algorithm used by the ransomware, but the decryption key is unavailable. Recommendations are made to restore from backups.

### Scenario 3: Data Exfiltration via Network Connections

**Objective**: Investigate data theft by analyzing network activity in memory and file transfers on disk.

#### Steps:
1. **Memory Analysis**: Identify active network connections that may have been used for data exfiltration.
2. **Disk Forensics**: Check logs, file transfers, and browser history for uploads or external services.
3. **Timeline Reconstruction**: Correlate network activity with file access timestamps.

#### Outcome:
The analysis reveals that the attacker used a third-party cloud storage service to exfiltrate sensitive data.

---

### Scenario 4: Insider Threat Investigation

**Objective**: Investigate unauthorized access and potential data theft by an internal user.

#### Steps:
1. **Memory Forensics**: Capture RAM to identify running processes and open documents.
2. **Disk Forensics**: Analyze deleted files, document modifications, and external drive usage.
3. **Correlate Logs**: Use system logs and file access logs to trace the insider’s activity.

#### Outcome:
Evidence shows the internal user accessed confidential files and attempted to erase traces by deleting file history. Recovered deleted files reveal sensitive data was copied to a USB device.

## Conclusion
Memory and disk forensics are powerful investigative techniques. While memory forensics provides insights into volatile data such as running processes and network connections, disk forensics helps recover files and analyze long-term activity. Together, they offer a comprehensive view of the security breach, enabling forensic investigators to reconstruct events, identify threats, and recommend preventive measures.
